# cadence-server
Dedicated Python webserver to run [Cadence Radio](https://github.com/kenellorando/cadence/)

This project is a module of Cadence, and is in development to replace the current Node.js server.

It is my intent that once development is complete enough to import into Cadence, I'll rebase this repository's master onto that of Cadence, adjust the directory structure for import, and pull request it onto Cadence.
